# The "MIT Double Attribution" (MIT-2) License

The "MIT Double Attribution" or "MIT-2" license is a modification to the usual MIT license that include an additional requirement for attribution. It is roughly the same as an MIT license consisting of a ham sandwich, except there is an additional slice of ham inside of the sandwich.

## Rationale

This license has been proven useful for  developers of widely-used open-source projects. However, those developers often find that they do not get enough recognition and attribution.

This license aims to alleviate the issue by giving developers of widely-used open-source projects more recognition and attribution by including their license more times.
